# Arduino with ESC and simple toy 2,4Ghz receiver

A simple Arduino code which I use to handle the signal from the 2.4 Ghz receiver pulled out of the toy to control the signal flowing to the ESC controlling the operation of the engine connected to the Longboard.
The receiver cannot be directly connected to the ESC due to signal incompatibility.
